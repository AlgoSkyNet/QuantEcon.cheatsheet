Variables
=========

Here are a few examples of basic kinds of variables we might be
interested in creating.

|  \|m6cm \| m11cm \| **Command** & **Description**

.. code:: julia

    A = 4.1
    B = [1, 2, 3]
    C = [1.1 2.2 3.3]
    D = [1 2 3]'
    E = [1 2; 3 4]

| & How to **create a scalar, a vector, or a matrix**. Here, each
  example will result in a slightly different form of output. ``A`` is a
  scalar, ``B`` is a flat array with 3 elements, ``C`` is a 1 by 3
  vector, ``D`` is a 3 by 1 vector, and ``E`` is a 2 by 2 matrix.

.. code:: julia

    s = "This is a string"

| & A **string** variable

.. code:: julia

    x = true

| & A **Boolean** variable

Vectors and Matrices
====================

These are a few kinds of special vectors/matrices we can create and some
things we can do with them.

|  \|m6cm \| m11cm \| **Command** & **Description**

.. code:: julia

    A = zeros(m, n)

& Creates a **matrix of all zeros** of size ``m`` by ``n``. We can also
do the following:

.. code:: julia

    A = zeros(B)

| which will create a matrix of all zeros with the same dimensions as
  matrix or vector ``B``.

.. code:: julia

    A = ones(m, n)

& Creates a **matrix of all ones** of size ``m`` by ``n``. We can also
do the following:

.. code:: julia

    A = ones(B)

| which will create a matrix of all ones with the same dimensions as
  matrix or vector ``B``.

.. code:: julia

    A = eye(n)

| & Creates an ``n`` by ``n`` **identity matrix**. For example,
  ``eye(3)`` will return :math:`\begin{pmatrix}
  1 & 0 & 0\\
  0 & 1 & 0\\
  0 & 0 & 1\\
  \end{pmatrix}`.

.. code:: julia

    A = j:k:n

| & This will create a **sequence** starting at ``j``, ending at ``n``,
  with difference ``k`` between points. For example, ``A = 2:4:10`` will
  create the sequence ``2, 6, 10``. To convert the output to an array,
  use ``collect(A)``.

.. code:: julia

    A = linspace(j, n, m)

| & This will create a **sequence** of ``m`` points starting at ``j``,
  ending at ``n``. For example, ``A = linspace(2, 10, 3)`` will create
  the sequence ``2.0, 6.0, 10.0``. To convert the output to an array,
  use ``collect(A)``.

.. code:: julia

    A = diagm(x)

| & Creates a **diagonal matrix** using the elements in ``x``. For
  example, if ``x = [1, 2, 3]``, ``diagm(x)`` will return
  :math:`\begin{pmatrix}
  1 & 0 & 0\\
  0 & 2 & 0\\
  0 & 0 & 3\\
  \end{pmatrix}`.

.. code:: julia

    A = rand(m, n)

| & Creates an ``m`` by ``n`` **matrix of random numbers** drawn from a
  **uniform distribution** on :math:`[0, 1]`. Alternatively, ``rand``
  can be used to draw random elements from a set ``X``. For example, if
  ``X = [1, 2, 3]``, ``rand(X)`` will return either ``1``, ``2``, or
  ``3``.

.. code:: julia

    A = randn(m, n)

| & Creates an ``m`` by ``n`` **matrix of random numbers** drawn form a
  **standard normal distribution**.

.. code:: julia

    A[m, n]

& This is the general syntax for **accessing elements** of an array or
matrix, where ``m`` and ``n`` are integers. The example here returns the
element in the second row and third column.

-  We can also use ranges (like ``1:3``) in place of single numbers to
   extract multiple rows or columns.

-  A colon, ``:``, by itself indicates all rows or columns

-  The word ``end`` can also be used to indicate the last row or column.

| 

.. code:: julia

    nrow, ncol = size(A)

& **Returns the number of rows and columns** in a matrix. Alternatively,
we can do:

.. code:: julia

    nrow = size(A, 1)

and

.. code:: julia

    ncol = size(A, 2)

| 

.. code:: julia

    diag(A)

| & This function returns a vector of the **diagonal elements** of ``A``
  (i.e., ``A[1, 1], A[2, 2]``, etc...).

.. code:: julia

    A = hcat([1 2], [3 4])

& **Horizontally concatenates** two matrices or vectors. The example
here would return :math:`\begin{pmatrix}
    1 & 2 & 3 & 4
    \end{pmatrix}`. An alternative syntax is:

.. code:: julia

        A = [[1 2] [3 4]]
        

| For either of these commands to work, both matrices or vectors must
  have the same number of rows.

.. code:: julia

    A = vcat([1 2], [3 4])

& **Vertically concatenates** two matrices or vectors. The example here
would return :math:`\begin{pmatrix}
    1 & 2 \\
    3 & 4
    \end{pmatrix}`. An alternative syntax is:

.. code:: julia

        A = [[1 2]; [3 4]]
        

| For either of these commands to work, both matrices or vectors must
  have the same number of columns.

.. code:: julia

    A = reshape(a, m, n)

& **Reshapes** matrix or vector ``a`` into a new matrix or vector, ``A``
with ``m`` rows and ``n`` columns. For example,

.. code:: julia

        A = reshape(1:10, 5, 2)
        

| would return :math:`\begin{pmatrix}
      1 & 6 \\
      2 & 7 \\
      3 & 8 \\
      4 & 9 \\
      5 & 10
      \end{pmatrix}` For this to work, the number of elements in ``a``
  (number of rows times number of columns) must equal ``m * n``.

.. code:: julia

    A[:]

| & **Converts matrix A to a vector.** For example, if
  ``A = [1 2; 3 4]``, then ``A[:]`` will return :math:`\begin{pmatrix}
          1 \\
          3 \\
          2 \\
          4
      \end{pmatrix}`.

.. code:: julia

    flipdim(A, d)

| & Reverses the vector or matrix ``A`` along dimension ``d``. For
  example, if ``A = [1 2 3; 4 5 6]``, ``flipdim(A, 1)``, will reverse
  the rows of ``A`` and return :math:`\begin{pmatrix}
      4 & 5 & 6 \\
      1 & 2 & 3
      \end{pmatrix}`. ``flipdim(A, 2)`` will reverse the columns of
  ``A`` and return :math:`\begin{pmatrix}
      3 & 2 & 1 \\
      6 & 5 & 4
      \end{pmatrix}`.

.. code:: julia

    repmat(A, m, n)

| & **Repeats matrix** ``A``, ``m`` times in the row direction and ``n``
  in the column direction. For example, if ``A = [1 2; 3 4]``,
  ``repmat(A, 2, 3)`` will return :math:`\begin{pmatrix}
      1 & 2 & 1 & 2 & 1 & 2 \\
      3 & 4 & 3 & 4 & 3 & 4 \\
      1 & 2 & 1 & 2 & 1 & 2 \\
      3 & 4 & 3 & 4 & 3 & 4 \\
      \end{pmatrix}`.

Mathematical Functions
======================

Here, we cover some useful functions for doing math.

|  \|m6cm \| m11cm \| **Command** & **Description**

.. code:: julia

    5 + 2
    5 - 2
    5 * 2 
    5 \ 2
    5 ^ 2
    5 % 2
        

| & **Scalar arithmetic operations**: addition, subtraction,
  multiplication, division, power, remainder.

.. code:: julia

    A + B
    A - B
    A .* B
    A ./ B
    A .^ B
    A .% B
        

| & **Element-by-element operations** on matrices. This syntax applies
  the operation element-wise to corresponding elements of the matrices.

.. code:: julia

    A * B
        

| & When ``A`` and ``B`` are matrices, ``*`` will perform **matrix
  multiplication**, as long as the number of columns in ``A`` is the
  same as the number of columns in ``B``.

.. code:: julia

    dot(A, B)
        

| & This function returns the **dot product/inner product** of the two
  vectors ``A`` and ``B``. The two vectors need to be dimensionless or
  column vectors.

.. code:: julia

    A'
        

| & This syntax returns the **transpose** of the matrix ``A`` (i.e.,
  reverses the dimensions of ``A``). For example if
  :math:`A = \begin{pmatrix}
      1 & 2 \\
      3 & 4 
      \end{pmatrix}`, then ``Aâ€™`` returns :math:`\begin{pmatrix}
      1 & 3 \\
      2 & 4
      \end{pmatrix}`.

.. code:: julia

    sum(A)
    maximum(A)
    minumum(A)
        

| & These functions compute the sum, maximum, and minimum elements,
  respectively, in matrix or vector ``A``. We can also add an additional
  argument for the dimension to compute the sum/maximum/minumum across.
  For example ``sum(A, 2)`` will compute the row sums of ``A`` and
  ``maximum(A, 1)`` will compute the maxima of each column of ``A``.

.. code:: julia

    inv(A)
        

& This function returns the **inverse** of the matrix ``A``.
Alternatively, we can do:

.. code:: julia

        A ^ (-1)
        

| 

.. code:: julia

    det(A)
        

| & This function returns the **determinant** of the matrix ``A``.

.. code:: julia

    val, vec = eig(A)
        

| & Returns the **eigenvalues** (``val``) and **eigenvectors** (``vec``)
  of matrix ``A``. In the output, ``val[i]`` is the eigenvalue
  corresponding to eigenvector ``val[:, i]``.

.. code:: julia

    norm(A)
        

& Returns the Euclidean **norm** of matrix or vector ``A``. We can also
provide an argument ``p``, like so:

.. code:: julia

    norm(A, p)

| which will compute the ``p``-norm (the default ``p`` is 2). If ``A``
  is a matrix, valid values of ``p`` are ``1, 2`` amd ``Inf``.

.. code:: julia

    A \ b
        

| & If ``A`` is square, this syntax **solves the linear system**
  :math:`Ax = b`. Therefore, it returns ``x`` such that ``A * x = b``.
  If ``A`` is rectangular, it **solves for the least-squares solution**
  to the problem.

Programming
===========

The following are useful basics for Julia programming.

|  \|m6cm \| m11cm \| **Command** & **Description**

.. code:: julia

        # One line comment

        #=
        Comment 
        block
        =#
        

| & Two ways to make **comments**. Comments are useful for annotating
  code and explaining what it does. The first example limits your
  comment to one line and the second example allows the comments to span
  multiple lines between the ``#=`` and ``=#``.

.. code:: julia

        for i in iterable
            # do something
        end
        

& A **for loop** is used to perform a sequence of commands for each
element in an iterable object, such as an array. For example, the
following for loop fills the vector ``l`` with the squares of the
integers from 1 to 3:

.. code:: julia

        N = 3
        l = zeros(N, 1)
        for i = 1:N
            l[i] = i ^ 2
        end
        

| 

.. code:: julia

        while i <= N
            # do something
        end
        

& A **while loop** performs a sequence of commands as long as some
condition is true. For example, the following while loop achieves the
same result as the for loop above

.. code:: julia

        N = 3
        l = zeros(N, 1)
        i = 1
        while i <= N
            l[i] = i ^ 2
            i = i + 1
        end
        

| 

.. code:: julia

        if i <= N
            # do something
        else
            # do something else
        end
        

& An **if/else statement** performs commands if a condition is met. For
example, the following squares ``x`` is ``x`` is 5, and cubes it
otherwise:

.. code:: julia

        if x == 5
            x = x ^ 2
        else
            x = x ^ 3
        end
        

We can also just have an if statement on its own, in which case it would
square ``x`` if ``x`` is 5, and do nothing otherwise.

.. code:: julia

        if x == 5
            x = x ^ 2
        end
        

| 

.. code:: julia

        fun(x, y) = 5 * x + y

        function fun(x, y)
            ret = 5 * x
            return ret + y
        end
        

& These are two ways to define **functions**. Both examples here define
equivalent functions.

The first method is for defining a function on one line. The name of the
function is ``fun`` and it takes two inputs, ``x`` and ``y``, which are
specified between the parentheses. The code after the equals sign tells
Julia what the output of the function is.

| The second method is used to create functions of more than one line.
  The name of the function, ``fun``, is specified right after
  ``function``, and like the one-line version, has its arguments in
  parentheses. The ``return`` statement specifies the output of the
  function.

.. code:: julia

        println("Hello world")
        

& How to **print** to screen. We can also print the values of variables
to screen:

.. code:: julia

        println("The value of x is $(x).")
